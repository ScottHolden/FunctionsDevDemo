# Functions Development Demo
## Demo Reel - Azure Functions for Developers

This is a quick demo for showing how to use Azure funcitons with common development patterns.

The demo is based around a local MongoDB instance and local functions debugging, then deploying to Azure on top of a Consumption plan with CosmosDB running in MongoDB API mode.

Included are build scripts, deployment script, sample tests, and an ARM template.
